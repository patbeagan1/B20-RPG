Creating an Adventurer

All creatures have 13 attributes, which fall into the categories `physical`, `mental` and `miscellaneous`.

The `physical` stats are Strength, Dexterity, Range, Endurance and Durability.
The `mental` stats are Intelligence, Wit, Charisma, Tenacity and Fortitude. The `miscellaneous` stats are Spirit, Speed and Awareness.

Stat Mods

Any stat can be turned into a `mod` by subtracting 10 and dividing it in 2. For example, if a character has 14 `Strength`, they would have `str mod` of 2, since `(14-10)/2 = 2`.
