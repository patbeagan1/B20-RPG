### Death and Dying
Death is relatively straightforward in this game. There are 3 stages of death: 
- Incapacitated 
- Dying  
- Dead
### Incapacitated
While Incapacitated, a character cannot attack, or perform complex actions. They can only move at half of their speed, if the situation allows them to move. A character can be Incapacitated at any health level, but having 0 health will always make a character Incapacitated, and susceptible to Dying. If an Incapacitated character with 0 health gets hit, the character goes into a Dying state.
### Dying
Dying is an intermediate state.  If they are hit again while in the Dying state, they become Dead. If they are healed while in the Dying state, they will automatically become Incapacitated with 0 health instead.
### Dead
If a character in the Dying state gets hit, they become Dead. When a character becomes Dead, their body and possessions remain where the character died. Unless otherwise specified, a character who is Dead will be resurrected at the nearest resurrection spot at the end of combat. They will be in a new body, of the same creature type, stats, and skills as the one who died. To rejoin the party and reclaim their items, they will have to travel to the party's current location.

Resurrection should not be treated lightly though - every time a character resurrects, they get a permanent stack of Soul Erosion, which applies -1 to all physical and mental stats.
### Soul Erosion
When a character is resurrected by almost any means, they get a permanent stack of soul erosion. This gives that character -1 to all Physical and Mental stats.
